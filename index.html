                <h1>Introduction Paris Law</h1>
    <p>Intestate succession among the Parsi community in India is governed by the Indian Succession Act, 1925. Prior to 1837, the English common law was applicable to the Parsis but their property was subject to certain exceptions such as marriage and bigamy. The Parsee Chattels Real Act, 1837 declared that as from 1 June 1837 the English law of primogeniture would not apply to any immovable property of the Parsis of Bombay but made them subject in all cases of intestacy as regards every description of property to the English Statute of Distribution. The Parsee Chattels Real Act, 1837 was the result of an appeal to the legislature by the Parsis of Bombay presidency when a Parsi died intestate, in 1835, and his eldest son claimed the whole of the immovable property in Bombay by the English law of primogeniture.</p>
    <p>Later, the Parsee Intestate Succession Act, 1865 was passed, which made significant changes by granting a right to a share in the property of a Parsi dying intestate to the widow and the daughters, who were earlier only entitled to a right to maintenance. These provisions relating to intestate succession were incorporated in the Indian Succession Act, 1925. Then the amending Act of 1939 substituted new rules. It improved the position of the widow and daughter relative to the son in respect of succession to the property of a male intestate; allotted a share in the estate of a male Parsi intestate to his father and mother; excluded the widower of a predeceased daughter of the intestate from the share given to him; and improved the position of widows of lineal descendants of the deceased. The amending Act of 1991 made further substantial changes, granting the widower equal right to a widow, improving the share of the daughter, giving parity of shares to the mother and father between themselves and including more classes of specified heirs.</p>

    <h2>Order of Succession</h2>
    <p>The Indian Succession Act, 1925 stipulates that in the event of a male or female Parsi dying intestate, the following will be the order of succession among the heirs:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>first in order are the following:
            <ul>
                <li>widow or widower, children and parents.</li>
                <li>lineal descendants, the nearer excluding the more remote,</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>then, next in order are the following heirs, the parents taking along with the heirs:
            <ol type="i">
                <li>father and mother.</li>
                <li>brothers and sisters (other than half brothers and sisters) and lineal descendants of such of them as have predeceased the intestate;</li>
                <li>paternal and maternal grandparents.</li>
                <li>children of paternal and maternal grandparents and the lineal descendants of such of them as have predeceased the intestate;</li>
                <li>paternal and maternal grandparents’ parents;</li>
                <li>paternal and maternal grandparents’ parents’ children and the lineal descendants of such of them as have predeceased the intestate,</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>thereafter, if the deceased leaves neither lineal descendants nor a widow or widower, nor a widow or widower of any lineal descendant, the heirs mentioned below succeed to the whole property:
            <ul>
                <li>father and mother;</li>
                <li>brothers and sisters (other than half brothers and sisters) and lineal descendants of such of them as have predeceased the intestate;</li>
                <li>paternal and maternal grandparents;</li>
                <li>children of paternal and maternal grandparents and the lineal descendants of such of them as have predeceased the intestate;</li>
                <li>paternal and maternal grandparents’ parents;</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Rules of distribution</h2>
    <p>The distribution of the estate of a Parsi intestate is made according to the rules which follow:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Widow or widower and children</strong>- When a Parsi dies intestate leaving a widow or widower and children, the distribution among them will be equal. In the absence of widow or widower, the children take among themselves equally. When the Parsi dies leaving one or both parents, children and a widow or widower, the property will be divided in such a way that the parent or each of the parents will take half the share that each child takes.</li>
        <li><strong>Predeceased child</strong>-When a Parsi dies, leaving any lineal descendant and a child of such intestate has predeceased him, the division of the share of the property of which the intestate has died intestate which such child would have taken if living at the intestate’s death must be in accordance with the following rules:
            <ul>
                <li>where the deceased child was a son, his widow and children will receive equal shares as if he had died immediately after the intestate’s death; but where such deceased son has left a widow or a widower of a lineal descendant but no lineal descendant, the residue of his share after such distribution has been made must be divided in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 as property of which the intestate has died intestate, and in making the division of such residue the deceased son of the intestate must not be taken into account;</li>
                <li>where the deceased child was a daughter, her share will be divided equally among her children;</li>
                <li>where any child of the deceased child has also died during the lifetime of the intestate, the share which he or she would have taken if living at the intestate’s death must be divided in the manner as stated in head (a) or (b) above, as appropriate;</li>
                <li>where a remoter lineal descendant of the intestate has died during the lifetime of the intestate, the rule set out in head (c) above will apply mutatis mutandis to the division of any share to which he or she would have been entitled if living at the intestate’s death by reason of the predecease of all the intestate’s lineal descendants directly between him or her and the intestate</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Next of kin</strong>- When a Parsi dies leaving neither lineal descendants nor a widow or widower nor a widow or widower of any lineal descendant, then his or her next of kin, in the statutory order are entitled to succeed to the whole of the property of which he or she dies intestate. The next of kin standing first in the list as provided in the schedule to the Indian Succession Act will be preferred to those standing second, the second to the third, and so on in succession, and the property must be distributed in such a way that each male and female standing in the same degree of propinquity receive equal shares</li>
        <li><strong>No specified relative</strong>- Where there is no relative entitled to succeed under any of the above rules, the property will be divided equally among those of the intestate’s relatives who are in the nearest degree of kindred to the intestate</li>

                    <h4>Answer:</h4>
                    <h1>Distribution of Donald Ponnawala's Wealth</h1>

                        <h2>Scenario 1: With Wife and Children</h2>
                        <p>As per Section 51(1)(a), a Parsi intestate's wife and children are entitled to receive the property in equal shares. In this case, Hilary, Hunter, Joe, and Haley are all entitled to receive an equal share of Donald’s property.</p>
                        <p>Donald’s property, valued at <strong>Rs. 900 crore</strong>, would be divided among his four heirs as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hilary Ponnawala:</strong> Rs. 225 crore</li>
                            <li><strong>Hunter Ponnawala:</strong> Rs. 225 crore</li>
                            <li><strong>Joe Sepstein Ponnawala:</strong> Rs. 225 crore</li>
                            <li><strong>Haley Ponnawala:</strong> Rs. 225 crore</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Scenario 2: If Hilary had Predeceased Donald</h2>
                        <p>If Hilary had predeceased Donald, Section 51(1)(b) would apply. This section states that in the absence of a widow/widower, the children divide the share equally. The division of the <strong>Rs. 900 crore</strong> estate would be as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hunter Ponnawala:</strong> Rs. 300 crore</li>
                            <li><strong>Joe Sepstein Ponnawala:</strong> Rs. 300 crore</li>
                            <li><strong>Haley Ponnawala:</strong> Rs. 300 crore</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Scenario 3: With Mother, Wife, and Children</h2>
                        <p>In the case that Donald’s mother, Ivanka Sethi, was also alive, in addition to his wife and all the children, Section 51(2) would be applied. As per this section, the widow and children would receive equal shares (1x), and the mother of the intestate would receive half of the share of the children (0.5x). The total property is <strong>Rs. 900 crore</strong>.</p>
                        <p>The division would take place in the following manner, using a ratio of 2:1 for ease of calculation (2x for the widow/children, 1x for the mother):</p>

                        <div class="reasoning">
                            <h3>Reasoning for Section 51</h3>
                            <p>Section 51 of the Indian Succession Act clearly focuses on the immediate family of the intestate, including the widow/widower, children, and parents. This section ensures equality among the widower and children, where the estate is divided equally among them. This is crucial as it ensures the widower's sustenance is not dependent on the children's will. It is only in the absence of a widow/widower that the children inherit the entire estate equally. Section 51(2) also acknowledges the obligation towards the deceased's parents by granting them a small part of the wealth while prioritizing the immediate family.</p>

                <h3>Case 2</h3>
                 <h1>The Estate of Donald Ponnawala</h1>

                <p>Mr. Donald Ponnawala, a former politician and a real estate mogul, and a devout Parsi, known for his crypto scam and for building "the wall" during his stint as the Prime Minister, died intestate on August 8, 2025. He left behind a wealth of <strong>Rs. 900 crore</strong>. He had claimed to be leading a celibate lifestyle, therefore he did not marry anyone during his lifetime and did not leave any known lineal descendants at the time of his death.</p>

                <p>His next of kin included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bill Ponnawala:</strong> Donald’s father, known for his promiscuous lifestyle and alcoholic addiction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Elon Ponnawala:</strong> Donald’s estranged brother, who married a Muslim from Egypt and had two sons with her. His marriage to a Muslim led the family to cut ties with him.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sofie Ponnawala:</strong> Donald’s sister, a successful architect and a devout Parsi wife.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ted Ponnawala:</strong> Donald’s half-brother, who was currently studying at the country’s premier law institute.</li>

                    <h4>Answer:</h4>
                    
                        <h1>Intestate Succession for a Parsi with No Direct Heirs</h1>
                        <p>In a case where a Parsi intestate has left neither a widow/widower nor any lineal descendants, the property would devolve as per <strong>Section 55</strong> of the Indian Succession Act. As per this section, the property will completely devolve to the next of kin as set out in <strong>Part II of Schedule II</strong>. The higher-ranked kin inherits the property completely, and nothing shall devolve to a lower-ranked kin in the presence of a higher-ranked kin. If there are multiple kin of the same rank, the property shall be divided among them equally.</p>

                        <h2>Distribution of Donald Ponnawala's Estate</h2>

                        <h3>Case 1: With Father Bill Ponnawala Alive</h3>
                        <p>Since the father is ranked first among all the kins in Part II of Schedule II, Donald’s father, Bill Ponnawala, will get the entire property of Donald, worth <strong>Rs. 900 crore</strong>. His brother Elon, sister Sofie, and half-brother Ted will not receive anything.</p>

                        <h3>Case 2: If Father Bill Ponnawala had Predeceased Donald</h3>
                        <p>In this scenario, the next of kin would be the brothers and sisters. In this case, it would be Elon and Sofie. Both would divide the estate in equal shares. The half-brother, Ted, would get nothing.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Elon Ponnawala:</strong> Rs. 450 crore</li>
                            <li><strong>Sofie Ponnawala:</strong> Rs. 450 crore</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is only in the absence of the father, brother, and sister that a half-brother would be eligible to inherit the property.</p>

                        <div class="reasoning">
                            <h3>Reasoning</h3>
                            <p>The Parsi intestate property division is primarily focused on the widow/widower and lineal descendants. It is only in the absence of any of them that the property will be distributed among the next of kin. Section 55 ensures that the property moves on to the closest living kin beyond the immediate family, according to a specified order of succession laid out in Schedule II Part II of the Act. This prevents the estate from being ownerless. The nearest kin (higher-ranked) is preferred to the second in line, reinforcing the idea of retaining the property within the family.</p>

                <p>Noshirwan Dastur, a visionary Parsi industrialist renowned for his construction company and for building many art-of-the-state buildings, has passed away.

                    <h4>Answer:</h4>
                    <h1>Noshirwan Dastur's Estate Distribution</h1>

                    <h2>Primary Heirs and Distribution</h2>
                    <p>According to <strong>Section 53(a)</strong> of the Indian Succession Act, the estate is divided equally among the deceased's widow and lineal descendants. In this case, the primary heirs are Shirin (wife), Farhad (son), and Delnaz (daughter).</p>
                    <p>Because both lineal descendants, Farhad and Delnaz, passed away before Noshirwan, the principle of 'per stirpes' (by the branch) applies. This means that each deceased lineal descendant’s share will pass down to their own descendants.</p>

                    <h3>Main Division (₹150 Crore Total)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Shirin Dastur (Widow):</strong> ₹50 Crore</li>
                        <li><strong>Farhad Dastur (Predeceased Son):</strong> ₹50 Crore</li>
                        <li><strong>Delnaz Dastur (Predeceased Daughter):</strong> ₹50 Crore</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Distribution of Predeceased Son Farhad's Share (₹50 Crore)</h3>
                    <p>Farhad's share goes to his widow (Meher) and two children (Rumi and Rita). It is divided equally as per Section 53(a) & 51(a).</p>
                    <ul class="sub-list">
                        <li><strong>Meher (widow):</strong> ₹16.6 Crore</li>
                        <li><strong>Rumi (predeceased son):</strong> ₹16.6 Crore</li>
                        <li><strong>Rita (daughter):</strong> ₹16.6 Crore</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Further Distribution of Predeceased Grandson Rumi's Share (₹16.6 Crore)</h4>
                    <p>Rumi is also predeceased but has lineal descendants. Section 53(d) would apply, and his share would be divided between his widow and child in accordance with Sections 53(a) and 51(a).</p>
                    <ul class="sub-list">
                        <li><strong>Katy (widow):</strong> ₹8.3 Crore</li>
                        <li><strong>Zenobia (daughter):</strong> ₹8.3 Crore</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Distribution of Predeceased Daughter Delnaz's Share (₹50 Crore)</h3>
                    <p>Noshirwan's predeceased daughter, Delnaz, will have her share divided among her husband (Zubin) and her children (Armin, Cyrus, and Nina), as per Sections 53(b) and 51(a). Note: The prompt states that the share would be divided amongst her husband and children, but according to the correct law (Section 53(b)), the share would be divided amongst her children and the widow/widower of the predeceased child receives a specific share. Assuming the division is equal for simplicity, based on the prompt's provided figures:</p>
                    <ul class="sub-list">
                        <li><strong>Zubin (husband):</strong> ₹12.5 Crore</li>
                        <li><strong>Armin (son):</strong> ₹12.5 Crore</li>
                        <li><strong>Cyrus (son):</strong> ₹12.5 Crore</li>
                        <li><strong>Nina (daughter):</strong> ₹12.5 Crore</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Status of Other Relatives</h2>
                    <p><strong>Khorshed (Sister):</strong> These relatives will not inherit anything. They are considered secondary heirs and would only inherit if there were no primary heirs (widow or lineal descendants).</p>

                    <div class="reasoning">
                        <h3>Reasoning</h3>
                        <p>The way in which Section 53 of the Indian Succession Act works for Parsis is that property goes 'per stirpes'. This reflects that the branch of each child receives property even if the child died before the main intestate. This ensures that the share of a predeceased child doesn’t vanish but rather passes on to their own lineal descendants. The provisos (a-d) cover different situations so that widows and remote descendants (like grandchildren or great-grandchildren) still get their proper share.</p>
                        <p>That’s why, in Noshirwan’s case, even though Farhad and Delnaz both died earlier, their families step into their shoes and get what they would have received. Rumi’s daughter Zenobia, though a more distant descendant, is also protected because of proviso (d).</p>
                        <p>As for Khorshed, since she is a sister (a collateral heir), she is excluded here because the law gives clear priority to the widow and lineal descendants. The Parsi scheme for succession prefers direct family lines over collateral heirs when distributing property.</p>

                <h3>Case 4</h3>
                <h1>The Estate of Jamsetji Tata</h1>

                <p>Jamsetji Tata, a visionary Parsi industrialist renowned for his love of animals and a notorious aversion to bureaucracy, has passed away, leaving an estate valued at <strong>₹100 Crore</strong>. True to his legacy, he never created a will.</p>

                </ul>

                <p>Due to a family rift, Dorabji had moved out a year earlier and was not in contact with his father. To compound the sorrow, Jamsetji’s mother, Ishwarbai Tata, passed away only a week before him.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Both of his sons (Dorabji and Ratan) are dead, as are his grandson (Naval), all having predeceased Jamsetji.</li>
                        <li>Jamsetji’s mother, Ishwarbai Tata, is also dead, having passed away a week before him.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Distribution of the ₹100 Crore Estate</h3>
                    <p>Since Jamsetji died leaving no living lineal descendant (his sons and grandson all predeceased him) but did leave a widow, the distribution is governed by <strong>Section 54</strong> of the Indian Succession Act.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Hirabai Tata (Widow):</strong> Receives <strong>₹50 Crore</strong>.
                            <p>According to Section 54(a), if the intestate leaves a widow but no lineal descendants or widow of a lineal descendant, the widow takes half of the property.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Nosherwanji Tata (Father):</strong> Receives <strong>₹50 Crore</strong>.
                            <p>The other half of the estate is the “residue.” As per Section 54(d), this residue must go to the next of kin in the order specified in Part I of Schedule II. The first-preference relatives are “Father and mother.” Since Jamsetji’s mother died a week earlier, the surviving father takes the entire residue.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Status of Other Relatives</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Children/descendants (Dorabji, Ratan, Naval):</strong> They receive no share, as they all predeceased Jamsetji. Section 54 applies only when no lineal descendant survives.</li>
                        <li><strong>Widow of a lineal descendant (e.g., Leah, or any spouse of Naval):</strong> No share. Leah died long before, and there is no living widow of any lineal descendant at the time of Jamsetji’s death. Therefore, clauses 54(b) and 54(c) do not apply.</li>
                        <li><strong>Jamshedbai (Sister):</strong> Excluded. Siblings are a lower rank than the father in Schedule II, Part I. Since the father survives and takes the entire residue, the succession never moves down to the siblings' rank.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sylla (Niece, child of a late sister):</strong> Excluded. Nieces and nephews are a lower rank than father/mother (and even siblings). With the father alive, Schedule II never reaches them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sooni (Remarried widow of a deceased brother):</strong> Excluded. Affinal relatives like a brother’s widow are not in the first rank of Part I, and the succession never gets past the father if he survives.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shapoorji Mistry (Stepson):</strong> Has no statutory protection under Parsi intestate law. Stepchildren are not considered “lineal descendants.”</li>
